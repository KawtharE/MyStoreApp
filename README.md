# My Store App Template

Full-Stack project with **BackboneJS v1.3.3** for the Front-end and **Flask v0.12.2** for the Back-end.

## Introduction

Working on **Large Scale Projects** need a good choice of technologies to work with, the main goal is to end up with a **robust, maintainable and bug-free application** that you or any other developer how have the source code can easily add new features to it in the future.

A good choice of technologies for your next big project start with thinking to work with one of the amazing **organizational frameworks** since it really makes things a lot easier than you have ever imagined. **BackboneJS** is one of these frameworks that belong to the **MV* Pattern Family** and what is great about it, is the fact that you end-up doing things in your own way in contrast of other organizational library like **AngularJS**, that make you do everything in its way.

Now for real world project, the presence of **Back-end** in the server side, make  a lot of sense since we need it to communicate with the **Database** where all of the project data exist. For this project we have been working with **Flask**, the pyhon micro-framework and **SQLAlchemy**, the ORM for a full SQL functionality. These two technologies have the advantage of being very flexible.
